      * - Simple RPG Subfile Example using a full load of 9999 records
      * - This program is a simple example of how to load a subfile with
      *   9999 records. The subfile is loaded with a counter value that
      *   increments by one for each record. The subfile is cleared
      *   before loading the records.
      * - The subfile is defined in the display file. The subfile is
      *   defined with a relative record number (RRN) field. The RRN
      *   field is used to identify the record number of the subfile.
      * - The subfile is loaded by a subroutine. The subroutine clears
      *   the subfile, increments the RRN, and writes the record to the
      *   subfile. The subroutine is called from the mainline code.
      * - The mainline code is a simple loop that calls the subroutine
      *   to load the subfile. The loop continues until the user presses
      *   the exit key.
      * - The program is compiled and run. The subfile is displayed with
      *   9999 records. The user can scroll through the records using the
      *   page up and page down keys. The user can exit the program by
      *   pressing the exit key.

      * Subroutine : #LODSFL
      * This subroutine is used to load the subfile with 9999 records.
      * The subroutine is called from the mainline code. The subroutine
      * clears the subfile, increments the RRN, and writes the record
      * to the subfile. The subroutine is called from the mainline code.

     C     #LODSFL       BegSr
      * Clear the subfile. Clearing a subfile involves the following four
      * statements.
      * 1. Switch on the SFLCLR indicator
      * 2. Write to the control format
      * 3. Switch off the SFLCLR indicator
      * 4. Reset the RRN to zero (Or one).
      * The fourth statement actually is not related to subfile. However,
      * we generally reset this value while clearing the subfile itself.

      * Increment the RRN to mark a new record of subfile. Remember that
      * the variable corresponding to RRN should not be less than one (1) a
